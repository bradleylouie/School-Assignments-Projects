*SquareMatrix*

  Very basic class implementing the rule of the Big Five; uses raw pointers and simple arithmetic to make a single vector act as a 2D array.
  
*KeywordsInFile*

  Reads two plaintext files - one containing keywords and the other a large text - constructing maps of the keywords and their occurrences within the text.
  Uses properties of BSTs and hashtables to look up these keywords, their total occurrences, and their occurrences per line in O(1) or O(logN) time.
  The contents of the files are parsed for contiguous alphabetical characters only - all others are converted to spaces (e.g. "it's" separates into "it" and "s").
